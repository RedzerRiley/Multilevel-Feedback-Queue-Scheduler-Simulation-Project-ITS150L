# Multilevel Feedback Queue (MLFQ) Scheduler Simulator

## Overview

This project implements a **Multilevel Feedback Queue (MLFQ) Scheduler** with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using PyQt6. The simulator demonstrates how operating systems schedule processes using multiple priority queues with different scheduling algorithms, aging mechanisms, and dynamic priority adjustments.

- **Four-Level Priority Queue System** with different scheduling algorithms per queue
- **Dynamic Priority Adjustment** through aging and demotion mechanisms
- **Multiple Scheduling Algorithms**:
  - First Come First Served (FCFS) - Queue 1
  - Shortest Job First (SJF) with optional preemption - Queue 2

## System Architecture

The system consists of two main components:

### 1. **Scheduler Logic (`mlq_logic.py`)**
- Core scheduling algorithm implementation
- Queue management and process state tracking
- Statistics calculation and event generation

### 2. **GUI Application (`gui_app.py`)**
- User interface for process input and parameter configuration
- Real-time simulation output display
- Gantt chart visualization using Matplotlib
- Statistical analysis presentation

## Queue Structure

The scheduler uses **4 priority queues**, numbered from highest (1) to lowest (4) priority:

| Queue | Priority | Algorithm | Preemption | Use Case |
|-------|----------|-----------|------------|----------|
| **Q1** | Highest | FCFS | No | Short, interactive processes |
| **Q2** | High | SJF (Preemptive) | Optional | I/O bound processes |
| **Q3** | Low | Round Robin | Yes (Quantum) | CPU-bound processes |
| **Q4** | Lowest | Round Robin | Yes (Quantum) | Background/batch jobs |

## Scheduling Algorithms

### Queue 1: First Come First Served (FCFS)
- Processes execute in **arrival order**
- **Non-preemptive** - runs to completion
- Ideal for short, high-priority tasks

### Queue 2: Shortest Job First (SJF)
- Selects process with **shortest remaining burst time**
- **Optional preemption** when shorter job arrives
- Minimizes average waiting time
- Toggle preemption via GUI checkbox

### Queues 3 & 4: Round Robin (RR)
- Each process gets a **time quantum**
- **Preemptive** - switches after quantum expires
- Fair CPU time distribution
- Prevents process starvation

## Technical Details

### Dynamic Priority Adjustments

#### **Aging (Priority Promotion)**
- Prevents process starvation
- When wait time â‰¥ aging threshold
- Process moves to higher priority queue (Q4â†’Q3â†’Q2â†’Q1)
- Wait time resets to 0
- Example: Process waits 5+ time units â†’ promoted

#### **Demotion (Priority Demotion)**
- Penalizes CPU-intensive processes
- Only applies to Q3 and Q4 (Round Robin queues)
- When process time â‰¥ demotion threshold
- Process moves to lower priority queue (Q3â†’Q4)
- Process time resets to 0
- Example: Process uses CPU for 6+ time units â†’ demoted

### Event Order in Main Loop

The scheduler processes events in this order each time unit:

1. **Process Arrivals** - Add newly arrived processes to queues
2. **Update Waiting Times** - Calculate time spent waiting
3. **Apply Aging** - Promote starving processes
4. **Select Next Process** - Choose from highest priority queue
5. **Execute Process** - Run for quantum or to completion
6. **Handle Preemption/Completion** - Demote, re-queue, or complete

### CPU Idle Optimization

When no processes are ready:
- **Old Behavior**: Increment time by 1 unit
- **New Behavior**: Jump directly to next arrival time
- **Benefit**: Dramatically faster simulation with sparse arrivals

```python
# Example: Time 10, next arrival at time 25
# Skips times 11-24 instantly
```

## Performance Metrics

### Calculated Statistics

For each process, the simulator calculates:

| Metric | Formula | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **AT** | User Input | Arrival Time |
| **BT** | User Input | Burst Time (total CPU needed) |
| **CT** | Simulation Result | Completion Time |
| **TAT** | CT - AT | Turnaround Time (total time in system) |
| **WT** | Accumulated Wait | Waiting Time (time spent waiting) |
| **RT** | First_Run - AT | Response Time (time to first execution) |

### Average Metrics

The system calculates averages across all processes:
- **Average Turnaround Time (Avg TAT)**
- **Average Waiting Time (Avg WT)**
- **Average Response Time (Avg RT)**

These metrics help evaluate scheduler performance and fairness.

## Algorithm Comparison

### FCFS (Queue 1)
**Advantages:**
- Simple, fair ordering
- No starvation
- Low overhead

**Disadvantages:**
- Convoy effect (short jobs wait for long jobs)
- Poor average waiting time

### SJF (Queue 2)
**Advantages:**
- Optimal average waiting time
- Good for I/O bound processes
- Preemption option for fairness

**Disadvantages:**
- Can cause starvation (mitigated by aging)
- Requires burst time estimation

### Round Robin (Queues 3 & 4)
**Advantages:**
- Fair time distribution
- Good for time-sharing
- Responsive for interactive processes

**Disadvantages:**
- Context switching overhead
- Higher average turnaround time
- Quantum selection critical

## Example Simulation

### Sample Run Output

```
ARRIVAL: P1 arrived at TIME 1 â†’ added to Q3
TIME 2: RUN P1 | Remaining=19 | Q=3 (RR) | PT=1
ARRIVAL: P2 arrived at TIME 3 â†’ added to Q2
TIME 4: RUN P1 | Remaining=18 | Q=3 (RR) | PT=2
AGING: P2 promoted from Q2 â†’ Q1
PREEMPTION: P1 preempted in Q2 (shorter job arrived)
TIME 5: RUN P2 | Remaining=9 | Q=1 (FCFS) | PT=1
...
PROCESS P3 completed at TIME 25
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: GUI doesn't launch
- **Solution**: Ensure PyQt6 is installed: `pip install PyQt6`

**Issue**: Gantt chart doesn't appear
- **Solution**: Install Matplotlib: `pip install matplotlib`

**Issue**: Process statistics show incorrect values
- **Solution**: Check that arrival times are sequential and burst times are positive

**Issue**: Simulation hangs
- **Solution**: Verify all processes have valid burst times (> 0)

- [ ] Priority inheritance for synchronization
- [ ] Real-time process constraints
